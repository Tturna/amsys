# TODO

Generalize app instance creation to support other kinds of apps.
- Don't force the user to give a container image when creating app instance
- Support running docker compose along with individual container images
- Figure out how to sensibly let the user select files to copy into the instance
  directory so they can be mounted

Go through all used env vars and document them. Make it so no AMSYS vars include
the ADDMAN name.

Message framework.

App name validation in instance creation form.
